# Custom authentication

Implementing custom authentication and authorization strategies was documented
in a [post on our blog](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/102037553745/writing-your-own-auth-plugins-for-npm-enterprise).

In addition to that, our GitHub integration is open source and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/npm/npme-auth-github).
